# Fish are food, not friends!

## Elevator pitch
Climb your way to the top of your aquarium's foodchain by consuming smaller fish so you can grow big to take on larger fish. Food from the sky, you can use it to help you on your adventure but you better be quick before another fish gobbles it up first. Garbage will also be falling so watch out as if you eat any garbage you will feel malnourished and shrink.

Grow large enough to eat all the fish in the tank, and you win!
